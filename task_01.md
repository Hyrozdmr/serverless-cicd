## Objectives

Learn:
- To use a fundamental AWS service: S3
- How to host a static website on AWS

## Create an S3 bucket

S3 is an [Object storage](https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/block-storage-vs-object-storage-cloud) service by AWS. 
Create an [S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and configure it to host a static website.

Is there a way you can test that public access to the static website works without having to build the whole deployment pipeline first?
