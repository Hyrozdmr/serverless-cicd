# Serverless CI-CD

This repository provides a skeleton with some files in order for you to get started creating:

- your own CI-CD solution using [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) 
- a Serverless backend for the site you will be deploying using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), following a common industry pattern.

In this README you will find:

- [Diagrams](#desired-application-and-deployment-process) that serve as the main description of what you should be building.
- A series of high-level [tasks](#getting-started) to guide you through the project.
- Some [documentation](#documentation) to help you understand the files in this repo 
- [Resources](#supporting-materials) that can serve as starting points to help you tackle some of the tasks.

## Desired application and deployment process

Below, you fill find some diagrams that describe the system you have been asked to build in a bit more detail. 

Even so, you'll find that they leave some questions unanswered: some arrows have been left unlabelled and the inner workings of some of the tools involved are not explained.
The missing bits are for you to research and discover!

### Application diagram

The following diagram shows how the application should work once deployed. 

![Application diagram](assets/application_diagram.jpg?raw=true "Application diagram")

The diagram shows that the app is composed of:
- a static site hosted on S3 and accessible through the browser,
- and a backend which the site sends requests to.

It also shows that the backend should be powered by AWS Lambda and that the frontend should access AWS Lambda through a service called Amazon API Gateway.

### Deployment process diagram

The next diagram illustrates how the application should be deployed:

- The code for the app should be hosted on GitHub
- Jenkins should be used to automatically deploy the application code to AWS S3.

## Getting Started

As a team, using the diagrams and high-level tasks shared below as a starting point, map out what you understand so far and what open questions you will need to research.

Keep modifying and expanding the diagrams you've been given with what you find.

## Set up S3

S3 is an [Object storage](https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/block-storage-vs-object-storage-cloud) service by AWS. 

- Create an S3 Bucket and configure it to host your static website.
- Check that the static site works by visiting it in your browser.

## Set up Jenkins

Set up an [EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html) using the [CloudFormation]((https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)) [template](deploy_ec2_network_v1.json) provided in this repo and install Jenkins on it.

> :information_source: The Jenkins-related tasks are likely to take some time and dedicated research. It is also likely that you encounter some obstacles along the way, so this is a great chance to get hands-on and sharpen your debugging skills by finding and reading through logs and error messages. You can do this!

### A few tips

1. The template is made to work pretty much as is. The *only section you need to modify* is the identifier for the S3 bucket you created previously. Can you spot where you need to add it?
2. Using the template, you will need to create something called a **stack** using the CloudFormation template on AWS.
3. You will know you have successfully installed Jenkins if when you open the **public IPv4 DNS address** of your EC2 instance in the browser, you get a `Getting Started` page with the following title: `Unlock Jenkins`.
4. Once you've unlocked Jenkins, install the plugins it recommends.

### Check your understanding

Jenkins can in fact run on your local machine, so why bother setting up an EC2 instance for Jenkins to run on it?

:pencil: Have a group discussion and think about the advantages and disavantages of each of these approaches before you move on.
If you think it would be useful for your understanding, make a note to discuss this with the cohort or a coach.

## Set up a CI-CD pipeline in Jenkins

### Create a diagram of your desired pipeline

Consult your diagrams again and revisit what you have learned so far about CI-CD pipelines and their benefits.
What checks and actions should your CI-CD pipeline perform? When should these checks and actions be run?
Remember that, ultimately, the idea is for the pipeline to only proceed to deploying the code if the checks pass.

![Deployment process diagram](assets/deployment_process_diagram.jpg?raw=true "Deployment process diagram")


If you haven't already, expand the diagram above so that it illustrates in more detail what should happen in the "Jenkins" step.
This will give you a better idea of what you want to use Jenkins for and help you research the right things.

> :information_source: The resources shared with you during the [CI-CD workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/devops-course/blob/main/workshops/week-2/ci_cd_overview.md) might help with this.

### Set up the pipeline

Below you will find a high-level list of the tasks that are necessary for you to sucessfully set up the Jenkins pipeline in CI-CD.

- Using the Jenkins classic UI, set up a new [Pipeline project](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/).
- Give Jenkins access to your GitHub repository by giving Jenkins the right **credentials**.
- Using a **webhook**, set up GitHub to automatically trigger your pipeline. What events should ideally trigger your pipeline to run?
- By writing a `Jenkinsfile`, set up the CI part of your pipeline. It should run checks to make sure the code in your repository is good to be deployed.
- Extend the `Jenkinsfile` with a step that deploys the application to the S3 bucket you created initially.

> :information_source: Not all of the tasks above need to be completed in the exact order they are given here.  Guides you may come across in your research might go through these in a slightly different order. So don't worry if you end deviating from the order presented here.

### Check your understanding

#### Understanding the `Jenkinsfile`

You've created a `Jenkinsfile`, but do you know how it works?
Spend some time understanding each line in the file and adding explanatory comments to it.

Here are a few questions to ask yourself and try to answer through a bit of research if need be:

- On what machine do the commands in your Jenkinsfile run?
- What part of your `Jenkinsfile` ensures that the correct version of Python will be available to run the code? How?
- What does the `stage` keyword mean? How does it relate to the diagram you drew to illustrate the CI-CD pipeline you planned?

Again, make a note to check your understanding with a peer, the cohort or a coach.

#### How does Jenkins get access to S3?

Via what mechanism did you give Jenkins access to make changes to your S3 bucket? 
Why did you need to do so? 

Illustrate the high-level process by which Jenkins is grant access to S3 on the deployment diagram but don't worry about understanding the AWS mechanisms behind this in full detail.
You'll be covering that in a future module!

## Set up the Serverless backend

Now that automatic deployment of the static site works, the next task is to make it dynamic by building a backend to which the frontend site can make requests.

> :warning: Before moving on to this task, make sure you have successfully deployed the HTML files to the S3 Bucket.

### Diagramming the backend

Revisit your diagram again. What services will you need to research next?

![Application diagram](assets/application_diagram.jpg?raw=true "Application diagram")

Can you flesh out your understanding of the connection between the static site, API Gateway and AWS Lambda?

Where could you look to figure out what kind of requests and responses the arrows represent?
Improve this diagram as you learn more.

### Tasks

- Using the AWS Lambda service in the AWS Console, set up set up an Python Lambda function whose definition matches the one in the [`your-first-lambda.py`](your-first-lambda.py) file. Do not forget to modify it!
- Set up an API Gateway **endpoint** which, will **invoke** the Lambda function you created whenever a request is made to it. Explore the [`www/index.html`](www/index.html) file. Can you spot which type of request the website performs?
- Connect the static site to the API Gateway endpoint.

### Check your understanding

You've set up your first Serverless backend, congratulations on the hard and great work!
Here are some questions to help you deepen your understanding of Serverless architectures and AWS Lambda:

- Is API Gateway the only way of invoking a Lambda function? Could you invoke a Lambda function directly? 
- What are the advantages of using API Gateway? Do some research and discuss what you find with a peer, the cohort or a coach.

Feel free to play around and try things out. 

## Bonus

Here are some pathways you might choose depending on what you want to learn next (go back to this week's learning objectives if you're unsure), how much challenge you want to take on, and how much structure or freedom you would like. 
Feel free to tackle them in any order you like â€” you almost certainly won't complete them all.

### Monitoring and debugging Lambda functions

Find out how to monitor and view logs for your Serverless backend in [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

You may want to deliberately add some logging to the Lambda function code or introduce bugs that will cause the code to throw errors - are you able to find evidence of that in the logs?

### Deploy the Lambda function automatically

Find a way to automatically deploy changes to the Lambda function code instead of manually pasting them into the AWS Console. 

### Use separate pipelines for testing and deployment

At the moment, the CI-CD pipeline immediately deploys whenever tests pass.
This might not always be appropriate or safe for all projects (why not?).

Find a way to *decouple* testing from deployment by using two different `Jenkinsfile`s rather than one.

### Feature testing

At the moment, the website has no feature tests that make sure that the backend and frontend work well together.
Research and build a way to automatically run feature tests against your Serverless app before deploying it to production.

### Improve your understanding of how DevOps tools work together

You've set up a connection between Jenkins running on the EC2 instance and your GitHub repository.
But how does it work?

- Via what mechanism does Jenkins find out there was a change to your GitHub repo? 
- How does Jenkins retrieve a copy of the code in the repository? 

 Drawing a [sequence diagram](https://playground.diagram.codes/d/sequence) is a good tool for investigating this. Here's an example to help you get started:

![Application diagram](assets/jenkins_github_sequence_diagram.svg "Application diagram")

Try to be as detailed and specific as possible in your descriptions of each step.
Share your diagram with a coach to get feedback.

## Documentation

### Project files

- Under the `www` folder, there are two files: `index.html` and `error.html`. These are the files we will deploy for our static website on an AWS S3 Bucket.
- `deploy_ec2_network_v1.json` is the [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) template to automate the process of creating an EC2 instance on AWS, assign the necessary roles and policies and add some security settings that are needed for Jenkins to be able to run on the EC2 instance. Note that you do not need to know what the whole template does line by line. We will, in fact, spend some more time next week working with these concepts on AWS.
- `your-first-lambda.py` is the Lambda function that you will deploy in AWS and eventually invoke once you deploy your static website on AWS. Modify it to include the names of your group members.
- `sample_unit_test.py` contains some sample unit tests and will serve you to test your CI job in Jenkins. One or more of the tests are failing at the moment. The framework used for the tests is [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- `assets` folder: files in this folder doesn't need to be deployed. It contains support assets for this README (e.g. images).
